## 🚀 About NullBin

NullBin is an open-source platform that provides a secure and private environment for storing text or code snippets. Born as a pastebin alternative, NullBin pays special attention to the anonymity and security of the stored data. The project is a work in progress, continuously striving to enhance its offerings. 

## 💼 Features

- Time-Limited Paste: Set an expiration time for your pastes [5 min, 10 min, 30 min, 60 min, 1 day, 1 week].
- Robust Encryption: Pastes are encrypted with AES-256-CBC using a randomly generated key.
- Decryption Key: Each paste's decryption key is shown only once.
- Session-Based Decryption: Pastes are decrypted within a session.

## 🌐 Overview

NullBin aims to provide a safe and private alternative for storing text and code snippets. We ensure the data remains anonymous during its lifetime. Post expiration, it is permanently deleted from the database.

Embracing open-source, we maintain transparency in data processing and service setup. We welcome contributors and users who wish to understand our service better or contribute to its development.
