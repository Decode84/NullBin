## Overview

The general purpose of the website is to offer an alternative to pastebin. With more focus on not knowing the data that is stored in the database during the time that the paste or snippet is set to be active. When the paste or snippet is no longer active, it should be deleted. 

The choice for open-source is to be transparent with how the data is processed and how the service is set up. This is to reassure those who might want to use the service or offer code for the project themselves.
